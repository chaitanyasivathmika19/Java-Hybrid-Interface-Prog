# Hybrid Inheritance in Java

This project demonstrates **Hybrid Inheritance in Java** using interfaces.  
Since Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes, we can achieve it through interfaces.  
Here, interfaces `A`, `B`, and `C` are extended and implemented by class `D`, while the `Main` class acts as the driver.
